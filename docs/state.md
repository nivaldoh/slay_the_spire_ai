# Project state

Updated 2026-10-14 19:35 UTC: what is running, where each game
stands and what comes next. History: [WH3 log](twwarhammer3/log.md),
[Spire full-run log](spire/fullrun/log.md), [first combat](spire/first-combat/README.md).

## Active work

WH3 benchmark work is active (owner goal, 2026-10-14): finish the paired benchmark,
difficulty/latency calibration and required interface fixes. Prioritize specialist
anchor units, faction mechanics and compact armies; see the
[scenario recipe](twwarhammer3/scenario-recipe.md). No scenario is admitted and no G1/G2
trials have run. The generic Herald G1 draft remains superseded; held-out maps are untouched.

The b7 queue on `82f5626` completed at 19:33:24 UTC; its runner and game controller
exited. No controller is active. Two Sol low-effort `llm_rules` pilots:
- Caster five versus ten: engine loss at 1077 s, five refusals, active margin -0.680,
  $1.78329. Ground Pendulum consumed magic and entered cooldown after issuance.
- Cavalry attacker six versus eight: engine win at 432 s, one refusal, active margin
  +0.433, $0.62009. Sol broke both handguns and the cannon, then the general/halberdiers.
  This demonstrates a viable strategy, not repeated calibration or admission.
Reports: `runs/twwarhammer3/reports/bench-b7-{caster,assault}-sol.json`.

The caster exposed missing public morale feedback and flight control. Read-only UI
queries showed the flyers' warning to attack by land at 793.3/836.2 s; at 1070.9 s
Kairos's largest effect was Army losses. Both flyers could toggle flight at 836.2 s.
No probe changed tactics. Evidence: `capability-probes/benchmark-flight-toggle/` and
`reports/bench-b7-caster-ground-acceptance.json` under WH3 runs.

Isolated b8 `a0a7108` in `/tmp/wh3-benchmark-b8` adds friendly leadership fraction/effect,
flight availability/cooldown and explicit landing/take-off requests for both model
controllers. Contract: `obs-v3+terrain/act-v2/live-1x`. It also adds a five-versus-ten
caster attacker family, retaining the roster/funds. All 215 WH3 tests with Lua, Ruff
and Lua 5.1 compilation pass; 72 benchmark/play tests pass after the track-label change.
Next: merge b8, run a separate flight-transition diagnostic, then screen Luna with
hold/attack-nearest on the cavalry attacker at 1.0/1.1 before freezing the reference.
WH3 spend is $6.2895 of $25. Sol's $0.62 pilot leaves too little margin for 30 repeated
reference trials; check the cheaper controller's competence first. No budget reset.
The diagnostic module is `/tmp/wh3-benchmark-controllers/flight_probe.py`; it uses only
public observations/orders, verifies landing, repeated landing and take-off, then
finishes with AttackNearest. Its transitions are not yet engine-tested.

Starting-formation geometry flags stay in primary comparisons, with a secondary
comparison excluding flagged launches; changed rosters/resources still require review.
Requested 0/6/10 s snapshot ages are minima; actual age at decision and issuance is
reported. Freeze the candidate/reference before G1/G2. Earlier screens, the recovered
b6 startup hang, and deliberately retired defender-evasion pilots remain in the
[log](twwarhammer3/log.md) and [progress page](twwarhammer3/benchmark-progress.md).

When a job starts, note here its game, job directory, start time (`date -u`) and `watch`
command; clear it when the job stops.

## Total War: WARHAMMER III battles

[README](twwarhammer3/README.md) (track page, full [Next](twwarhammer3/README.md#next)),
[battle types](twwarhammer3/battle-types.md), [controllers](twwarhammer3/controllers.md),
[integration](twwarhammer3/integration.md), [log](twwarhammer3/log.md). `main` runs
`llm` v15 and `commander` v3 (every battle type's objectives, `build` and `reinforce`
orders) and the `skills` executor v1.2. API spend: $6.2895 of the $25 cap
(after the b7 specialist pilots).
The owner has authorized benchmark calibration, including AI modifiers 1.0 and 1.1.
Both lobby and battle read-backs passed. Fresh 5.2 s startup snapshots show all 12 AI
unit entries changing at 1.1 (roughly +10% attack/defence/damage/charge, +8 leadership),
with the 12 player entries unchanged. These differences appear even in UI ValueBase;
b3 also captures current Value to distinguish other active effects. See the progress page.

2026-10-14 overnight (owner goal: one minimal test scenario per battle type, vertical
slices toward the benchmark): done for all nine types (conquest, domination,
free-for-all, ambush, chokepoint, subterranean, minor settlement, siege, survival).
Each sets up unattended, reports its objectives in the state (`mode`), has the orders
it needs and ended on an engine result with `attack_nearest`, Luna `llm` v15 and Luna
`commander` v3; `probe_abilities` verified building and buying in the engine. Results
and gaps: [battle-types.md](twwarhammer3/battle-types.md); engine facts:
[integration.md](twwarhammer3/integration.md#battle-types-probed-2026-10-14).

Current owner goal: complete the first three benchmark steps recommended in the
2026-10-14 status discussion (paired benchmarks, calibration/latency experiments, required
interface fixes). Remaining longer-term directions:
1. Battle types toward benchmarks ([battle-types.md](twwarhammer3/battle-types.md#next)):
   variants per type (the `random-<type>` draws, both roles), calibration of the
   scripted controllers per type, and the interface gaps found (no deployment phase, no
   terrain, survival wave timing).
2. Resume the random-draw model comparison later (three seeds left, in the
   [log](twwarhammer3/log.md)), then Sol and Astra as commander on the same draws.
3. Eventually we could turn this game into some kind of serious LLM benchmark? For now I'm just registering this here. Could try to create certain challenge scenario battles where the opponent side is stronger, and see how well different models perform and whether they discover certain key insights required to win these battles. Eventually these challenge scenarios could even be AI-generated themselves.
   2026-10-14: the owner's brief and a draft definition to discuss (analysis of the
   harness, spec, one concrete instance): [twwarhammer3/benchmark.md](twwarhammer3/benchmark.md).
   Owner notes on sieges (2026-10-14 night): benchmark who holds the victory points
   over time and the supplies left unspent; both are now measured per episode.

## Slay the Spire

Full runs with an API model ([README](spire/fullrun/README.md): reference and loop;
[log](spire/fullrun/log.md): versions), idle since 2026-10-13; v10 is on `main`, untested.
No run has won; the furthest reached Act 4 (v8, floor 54); `uv run python -m spire stats`
gives acts, wins and floors per version. API spend: $2.52 of the $25 cap
(`uv run python -m spire spend`, 2026-10-13). Open owner decisions:
[fullrun/README.md](spire/fullrun/README.md#open-owner-decisions). Paused: the first-combat
track ([README](spire/first-combat/README.md)). Planned: a remotely trained open-weight
model ([README](spire/open-weight/README.md); only a skeleton in `src/spire/openweight/`).

Next steps:
1. Replay v10 (`54a5967`, hand-select purpose) on `RUNDEV1`–`RUNDEV3`: its only job died
   on floor 10 at a WSL restart, so it and its settings-screen `key cancel` are untested.
2. Keys memory (drafted as v11 on branch `v11-keys`, unmerged): CommunicationMod 1.2.1
   never sends `keys`, so the model cannot see the keys it holds; v9 RUNDEV1 died on an
   elite path taken for a key it had ([integration.md](spire/integration.md),
   [candidates](spire/fullrun/README.md#candidate-changes)).
3. The rest of the results register ([results.csv](spire/fullrun/results.csv)): SpireBench's
   other measures, before more versions are compared. SpireBench released no code; its
   metric definitions and fixed held-out seeds carry over
   ([ideas](spire/fullrun/README.md#ideas-from-related-work-2026-10-12)).
4. An open StS1 full-run benchmark built from this harness: owner interest, scoped in the
   [approaches.md addendum](spire/approaches.md#addendum-2026-10-12-evening-an-open-sts1-benchmark).

## Owner direction

WH3:
- 2026-10-14 (benchmark steering): specialist anchor units and faction-specific mechanics
  should drive scenario design. Prioritize extreme tactical problems (cavalry against
  anti-large, caster-led forces, difficult sieges, commanding/fighting Skaven swarms),
  meaningful creative choices and battles worth watching; well-rounded armies can follow.
  Small armies on either or both sides are equally suitable; high funds and large
  rosters are not requirements. Start the first specialist prototypes compact.
- 2026-10-13: an API model plays real-time battles, with the order delay measured; control
  through an in-game mod, never screenshots or desktop input; a hard $25 cap on its own
  ledger, `runs/twwarhammer3/llm-spend.jsonl`. Battles always run unpaused at 1x.
- 2026-10-13 (evening): an asynchronous `commander` over scripted `skills`, beside the
  direct `llm`; the other designs wait in [controllers.md](twwarhammer3/controllers.md).
- 2026-10-13 (late): evaluate on paired random draws (`--scenario random`, the same seeds
  for every controller, races drawn, armies autogenerated) at AI difficulty very hard;
  fixed scenarios only for quick diagnostics. Other battle types next.

Slay the Spire:
- 2026-10-12: complete runs by a frontier API model (`gpt-6-luna`, low effort), scaffolding
  found by autoresearch from observed mistakes; a hard $25 cap on `runs/llm-spend.jsonl`.
- 2026-10-12: interest in an open StS1 benchmark, since SpireBench's code is not public.
  Later, a remotely trained open-weight model (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, then GLM-5.3, RL on Tinker).
- 2026-10-11: PPO paused for language-model post-training, itself paused for full runs.

## Runtime and ownership

- Slay the Spire ([runtime facts](spire/integration.md#runtime-and-source-pins)): the owner
  authorizes the installed Steam game and personal profile slot 0, including changes to
  stats, unlock progress, run history and achievements (Ironclad unlock level was 3 of 5
  on 2026-10-11; runs record profile evidence).
- WH3: [engine facts](twwarhammer3/integration.md). A launch builds the mod into
  `C:/wh3-agent/mods`, writes `twwarhammer3_mods.txt` into the game folder, installs the
  startup-video skip pack `data/zzz_twwarhammer3_skip_intro.pack` and sets
  `fe_game_intro_video_enabled false`; both persist for ordinary Steam launches
  ([how to reverse](twwarhammer3/README.md#commands)).
- Also authorized: game windows, local GPU work, commits and pushes to public `main`, and
  paid OpenAI API use within each ledger's cap. One game controller at a time across both
  games (each game's lock and process check cover only that game); one GPU job at a time.

## Unmerged branches

- `wh3-benchmark-b8` (`a0a7108`): compact caster attacker candidates, morale feedback and
  flight-state requests; isolated while b7 runs, landing/take-off still need an engine test.
- `integration/heldout-clip-continuation` (`940d698`): first-combat work, on `01f2984`.
- `v11-keys` (`cd97667`): Spire v11 keys memory, on v10 (`54a5967`).
- `wh3-fire-report` (`832b233`): WH3 fire-report candidate, on v9 (`d928965`); untested.
- `wh3-v4-info` (`aa1ece5`): WH3 orientation and losses candidate, on v3 (`c34c246`).
