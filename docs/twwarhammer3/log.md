# WH3 battle versions

One entry per harness version: what changed, the job, and the results. The scenario is
fixed unless an entry says otherwise: `kho5-dwf5`, a custom battle on "An Ogre's Folly",
Khorne (player: Herald of Khorne, Chaos Warriors, Bloodletters, Marauder Horsemen with
throwing axes, Skullcannon) against Dwarfs under the game AI (Lord, Dwarf Warriors,
Longbeards, Quarrellers, Grudge Thrower), unit size large, real time at speed 1, a
decision 5 s of battle time after the previous orders applied. Rows are in
[results.csv](results.csv); `python -m twwarhammer3 digest <job>[/episode-NNNN]` reads
the evidence.

## Baselines

`attack_nearest` (every unit attacks its nearest visible enemy), source `60314c3`, job
`attack-m3-20261013`: lost at 344 s, won at 400 s. Before `c3c9177` the baseline did not
re-order units whose attack had lapsed, so units stood idle under fire for minutes; the
two episodes understate it.
